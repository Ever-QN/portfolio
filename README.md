# Quynh's Portfolio

**WIP! WIP! WIP!**

Hello there, and welcome to my portfolio! My name is Quynh, and I'm a programmer with a passion for creating solutions to complex problems. In this portfolio, you'll find examples of my work, ranging from small scripts to (eventually) larger-scale projects.

As you navigate through my portfolio, you'll see that I have experience in a variety of programming languages and technologies. Regardless of how many I know, I'm always seeking new challenges and ways to expand my skill set.

In each project, I strive to create code that is not only functional, but I also try my best to make it maintainable and easy to understand. I believe that well-written code is not just a product of good programming practices, but also an art form.

Thank you for taking the time to view my portfolio. If you have any questions or would like to discuss a potential project, feel free to reach out to me.
^Not through the website email contact though, I still have to add functionality for that later on
