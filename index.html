            <p>Hello, I'm Quynh! I am a software development student at SAIT who has a passion for coding and a drive to learn more about the ever-evolving world of technology. I have a keen eye for detail and a natural talent for problem-solving and I am always looking to improve and work on my skills whilst being open minded to trying new things out. </p>            
            <p>When I am not busy coding, I enjoy going to the gym to workout and also like to look in to what is happening with the current technologies in the market. I have spent about 1.5 years programming at the time of writing this (written 2023). At the moment, I am currently going through a course for Ruby, with the end goal being able to make some projects with Ruby On Rails</p>
            <p>With my combination of technical skills and creative energy, I want to make an impact in the world of software development, and I am excited to see where this journey will take me.</p>
